# Percolation

This is my own code and it's not full.
Couldn't get the input samples as I self-learned this course on my own for free.
Almost all the functions needed to solve this problem as far as I can think of it are there.
I'm still a beginner so don't expect much of this code.
I know I've got tons of bad coding habbits so excuse me.
